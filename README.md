## 💡 How does it Work?  
Every 15 days, the creators update their donors, adding a new exclusive NFT with each update. This keeps the project eligible to receive donations. Donors receive an NFT, and creators can redeem the donated funds through a quadratic voting process held every 24 hours

## 🚀 Innovation
- The Batshare simplifies the process of donations and project creation, making it accessible and rewarding. Through the BAT currency, donations become easy, and NFTs add extra motivation for donors to participate in each update. This helps donors stay updated on projects and encourages creators to make improvements for the community.
    
- An important innovation is our approach to the quadratic function, eliminating complex rounds and allowing projects to receive donations continuously while expediting payments.
    
- We have designed an intuitive interface that allows users to create projects and contribute in seconds. Additionally, we facilitate direct communication between donors, collaborators, and creators, promoting closer and more efficient interaction.
    
- We value neutrality, security, and transparency on our platform. Projects are displayed randomly, avoiding any bias. We also use Blockchain technology to ensure security and transparency in transactions.
